Used the library <stdlib.h> to be able to use exit() function to terminate the program. It was my individual research. This library contains functions for memory management, process control, conversions, and random number generation. Popular and good-to-know functions from this library are: malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), free(), atoi(), atof(), rand(), srand(), and exit()
Used the library <ctype.h> to be able to use toupper() function for menu purposes. It was my individual research as well. This library contains functions for classifying and transforming individual characters, most popular ones good to know are:
-isdigit()- checking for a decimal digit 
-character islower()- checking for a lowercase letter
-isupper()- checking for an uppercase letter
-tolower()- converting an uppercase letter to lowercase equivalent.
-toupper()- converting a lowercase letter to uppercase equivalent.*/
Used switch to choose menu options instead of loops or if statements 
Used getchar() function as a menu selection
